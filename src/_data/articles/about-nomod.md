Today, Nomod replaces your clunky card terminal with a simple, intuitive way to accept in-person card payments right on your device!

Whilst we're deeply focused on building an incredibly good payments experience, with thoughtful features, bringing on new ways to get paid, and continuing to expand into new markets, our longer term ambition is build a **better banking experience for your business**.

If it involves accepting, holding, or moving money electronically, we want to be all over it. We believe that the future of business banking is going to be unexpected, seamless, and incredibly disruptive. If you think the era of digital banking is already upon us, you haven't seen anything yet ;)

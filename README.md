This is the Nomod Way, Nomod's handbook on how we run our business! Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)!

## Installing Locally

3. Navigate to your repo directory and run `npm install`

To get a development server up and running:

1. Run `gatsby develop`

2. Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at localhost:8000

## Production Build

1. Run `gatsby build`

2. To serve the production build locally, run `gatsby serve` and Gatsby will start a local HTML server for testing, by default at localhost:9000
